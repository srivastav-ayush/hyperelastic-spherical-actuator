# Hyperelastic rotating spherical balloon actuator
This project involved static modeling and finite element simulation of a spherically-shaped hyperelastic balloon actuator subjected to angular rotation and internal air pressure. Spherical actuators have application in soft robotics and for haptic feedback in robot assisted surgeries.
